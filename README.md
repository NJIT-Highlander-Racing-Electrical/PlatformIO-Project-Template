# PlatformIO Project Template
General example for how a PlatformIO project should be organized.
## About
Using Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO IDE extension allows for a smooth integration of project development and sharing via GitHub. Additionally, PlatformIO compiles projects and uploads them to ESP-32 boards signifigantly faster than the Arduino IDE does. It also provides several features for managing libraries, including custom ones.
## Requirements
- [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the following extension(s):
  - PlatformIO IDE
## Creating a Project - needs to be tested
1. Create a new repository with from this template.
2. Follow the instructions below to open the project.
## Opening an Existing Project
If you already have the repository for the project downloaded, skip steps 1 & 2.
1. In the GitHub Desktop App, click File->Clone Repository `Control+Shift+O`.
2. Select the desired repository from the list, and click the clone button.
3. Make sure the current repository (top left) is the one you want to open.
4. Make sure you have the latest files downloaded.
5. Click the `Open in Visual Studio Code` button.
   
Visual Studio Code should now open and initialize the repository as a PlatformIO project.  
Changes can be pushed/pulled using either the Github Desktop App or Visual Studio Code's `Source Control` interface.
